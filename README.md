I took this class because I have an interest in working with large datasets and learning more about machine learning. I find data science to be an interesting field and would like to learn more about it.

On top of machine learning and doing statistics, doing data cleanup and manipulation in code

I have been coding for years, so I hope to be able to help with some of the more complicated programming things we do in classes.
